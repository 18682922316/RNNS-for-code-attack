# RNNS-for-code-attack
This is the prototypical implementation for the paper "black-box adversarial attack guided by model behavior for programming pre-trained language models".

For simplicity, we only provide the prototypical implementation of the codebert+authority task, the prototypical implementation of other tasks is basically the same.

# Acknowledgement
We are very grateful that the authors of ALERT(Natural Attack for Pre-trained Models of Code), CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, CodeXGLUE, CodeT5, MHM make their code publicly available so that we can build this repository on top of their code.
